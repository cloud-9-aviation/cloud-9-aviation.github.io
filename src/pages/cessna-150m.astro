const overview = [
  `The Cessna 150M aircraft rental is a two-seat, single-engine,
    high-wing airplane that has long been a favorite for flight training,
    pilot instruction, and time building. Known for its reliability,
    easy handling, and economical operating costs, this Cessna 150 rental
    is an excellent choice for student pilots, hour-building pilots,
    and recreational flying within a professional flight club environment.`,
  `This airplane, upgraded with a Lycoming engine, is a significantly
    enhanced version of the classic trainer, transforming it from its original
    100-horsepower Continental configuration into a much more capable
    150-horsepower performer.`,
  `To increase the aircraft's useful load wheel
    pants were removed, providing a weight reduction that allows more flexibility
    for fuel, passengers, or training needs.`,

const equipmentSummary = [
  `The Cessna 150M comes with upgraded and basic VFR instruments, including an airspeed indicator, altimeter, vertical speed indicator, and fundamental navigation equipment.`,
  `Upgraded avionics suite replaces the stock setup with modern, IFR-ready equipment. The Garmin GNC-355 with WAAS provides GPS/NAV/COMM and precision approaches, paired with a GNC-255 COMM and Stratus transponder for ADS-B OUT compliance and optional traffic/weather data, far beyond what a basic legacy stack offers.`,
  `Engine monitoring is enhanced with a JPI-730 showing individual CHT and EGT for each cylinder, while the Garmin GMA-345 audio panel adds ATC playback and Bluetooth connectivity, replacing the older analog instruments and audio panels lacking digital features.`,
