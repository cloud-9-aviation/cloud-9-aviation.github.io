  `The Cessna 177 features a well-balanced mix of traditional and modern flight instruments, combining dependable analog backups with a contemporary primary flight display. The Aspen E5 PFD provides a solid-state attitude and heading reference, digital airspeed and altitude, and a clear situational picture, while the GI 106B CDI and remote sensor modules support precise navigation and system reliability beyond a purely legacy panel.`,
  `The avionics suite is centered around the Garmin GNS 530 WAAS, delivering IFR-certified GPS/NAV/COMM capability with LPV approach support. This is complemented by a NARCO Mark 12D second radio and the Garmin GTX 345 transponder, providing full ADS-B IN/OUT, including in-cockpit traffic and FIS-B weather, significantly enhancing both compliance and enroute awareness compared to older transponder-only configurations.`,
  `Pilot workload and cockpit connectivity are further improved with a PS Engineering audio panel and four-place intercom, paired with the Garmin Flight Stream 210 for seamless wireless integration. This allows flight plans, traffic, and weather to be shared directly with iPad-based apps such as ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot, creating a highly capable, connected IFR platform well suited for cross-country and training operations.  `,
